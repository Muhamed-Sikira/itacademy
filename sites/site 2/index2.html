            <h1>Agents</h1>

            <p>There are a large variety of playable agents available in the game. Each agent has a different class which indicates how the agent is usually played. Duelists are the offensive line, which specializes in attacking and entry fragging for the team. Duelists include Jett, Phoenix, Reyna, Raze, and Yoru. Sentinels are the defensive line, which specializes in locking down sites and protecting teammates from enemies. Sentinels include Sage, Cypher, and Killjoy. Next are initiators who plan out the offensive pushes. Initiators specialize in breaking through defensive enemy positions. Initiators include Skye, Sova, and Breach. The last class are the Controllers, who specialize in setting their team up for success. They use their heavy utility to control sightlines on the map. Controllers include Viper, Brimstone, Omen and Astra.</p>

            <p>More than guns and bullets, youâ€™ll choose an Agent armed with adaptive, swift, and lethal abilities that create opportunities to let your gunplay shine. No two Agents play alike, just as no two highlight reels will look the same.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>

                <p>Agents have one Signature Ability which they get for free each round. Riot was aiming to launch the game with 12 agents, but only 8 were available in the early press builds.[1] The March 29, 2020, private event introduced Breach. Since the Closed Beta launch on April 7, 2020, Raze was added along with the map Split, bringing the Agent total to 10. Five agents are available at first launch, with two more that can be easily unlocked by leveling up in the game. More agents can be unlocked by taking Contracts and gathering XP on them. Agents have a base health of 100; Light Shields bring the maximum health to 125, and Heavy Shields to 150. It is the intention of the developers that one agent be released per act.</p>
